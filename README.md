# Threshold Exceedance Forecasting Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources related to our research paper titled "Survival analysis as a risk stratification tool for threshold exceedance forecasting," which has been accepted as a full paper at the KMIS 2023 conference. In addition to our proposed method, we have included various other methods for threshold exceedance forecasting, sourced from the existing literature. These additional methods are included for the purpose of comparison with our proposed approach.

## Paper Citation
If you find our work or the methods included in this repository useful for your research, please consider citing our paper:

**Title:** Survival analysis as a risk stratification tool for threshold exceedance forecasting  
**Authors:** George Marinos, Manos Karvounis, Ioannis N. Athanasiadis  
**Conference:** KMIS 2023  
**DOI:** [Insert DOI link when available]

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the proposed method and other comparative methods. The two scripts named data_preprocessing & model_trainning_and_evaluation include the two main classes of the framework which are the data_processor and the data_evaluator. 
- `config.yaml/`: Please fill in this file with your parameters.
- `examples/`: This directory stors examples of usage of the framework.
- `results/`: This directory stores the results generated by the code, including any figures or tables.
- `plots/`: This directory stores the plots generated by the docker execution

## Getting Started
If you wish to use the framework, please follow the examples in the corresponding folder (replace the paths with your own paths etc.) and use the functions from the source code directly (either from a jupyter notebook either in from a .py file) and run your experiments. 

*Note that for the previous case the main.py is not necessary. The main.py file was created for EFRA (demonstration) purposes, and is used by the docker in order to run the code and save the output results and plots. 

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to [EFRA] for their support and contributions to this research.
